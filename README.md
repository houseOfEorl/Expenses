# Expenses

I'm tracking my Expenses using a new stack of web technologies including:

- ASP.NET Core 2.0
- Entity Framework Core 2.0
- React

With this project I want to:
 - Control my expenses using a web page
 - An email service to automatically add new expense every time that the bank send an email with a new transaction
